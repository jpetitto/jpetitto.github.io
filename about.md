My name is John and I'm a software engineer living in Austin, TX. I currently work in the Mobile Innovation Lab at IBM.

I mainly talk about Android and other related things on my blog. I'm also interested in reactive programming, Kotlin, functional programming, compilers, API design, and open source software.
