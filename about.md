## About me

My name is John and I'm a software engineer living in Austin, TX. I currently work in the [Mobile Innovation Lab](http://www.ibm.com/innovation/milab) at IBM.

I mainly talk about Android and other related topics on my blog. I'm also interested in functional programming, compilers, API design, and open source software.
