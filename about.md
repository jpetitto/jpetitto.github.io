## About me

I'm a software engineer currently living in Los Angeles, CA. I build Android apps for [Wallaby Financial](https://www.walla.by/). Previously I worked at IBM's [Mobile Innovation Lab](http://www.ibm.com/innovation/milab).

You'll find me writing mostly about Android on my blog. I'm also interested in functional programming, compilers, API design, and open source software.

You can reach me by [email](mailto:john.petitto@gmail.com) or find me on any of the following networks:
